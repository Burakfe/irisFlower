# irisFlower
Deep Learning algorithm
I have sourced the comments for a better understanding of the code and the pyTorch library as I am using for the first time. A basic Neural network that Identifies the variety of the iris flower based on its sepal length	sepal width	petal length	petal width. I have used Jaeho Shin's dataset for this purpose (https://gist.github.com/netj/8836201).
